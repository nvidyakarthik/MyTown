# MyTown

My Town will be a website where visitors will be able to find places of interest around a specific location. Users will be able to post places they’ve visited, i.e. museums, good hikes, places to find live music, etc.. There will be a filter option to narrow searches, and a search by location option. Finally, there will be an “Events Happening This Week” section where upcoming local events will be displayed.
